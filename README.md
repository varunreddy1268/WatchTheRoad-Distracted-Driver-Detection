# Watch The Road - Distracted Driver Detection

Distracted driving is a significant cause of accidents, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries each year. 
This project aims to leverage computer vision and machine learning to detect inattentive drivers using dashboard 
cameras, ultimately reducing accidents caused by distracted driving. The State Farm Distracted Driving image dataset, 
comprising over 100,000 labeled images, forms the basis of our research. We explore various state-of-the-art machine 
learning algorithms to classify images into ten different actions, such as safe driving, texting, talking on the phone, 
and more. The project consists of key phases including data exploration, model building, website development, and model deployment. 
In addition to the models, we built a website to showcase our work. The website allows users to upload an image, which is then processed 
by our trained model to predict the driver's behavior.
